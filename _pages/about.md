I am a senior computer engineering student at Computer Engineering at [Shahid Beheshti University](https://encse.sbu.ac.ir/).
Currently, I am working on Fine-tuning and prompt engineering in Large Language Models in a way that better results in fixing bugs under the supervision of [Dr. Haghighi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rVA_FtIAAAAJ&hl=en). 
<br>
My research interests include Natural Language Processing with applications in Large Language Models. I intend to better understand these methods in a principled manner by investigating their underlying mathematics and their practical implications in real life. 
My research goal is to channel such a better theoretical and functional understanding of these new methods toward better practical solutions for problems.

- Large Language Models
- Natural Language Processing
- Applied Machine Learning in Software
- Deep Reinforcement Learning

## Education

- B.Sc. in Computer Engineering, Shahid Beheshti University, (2020 - present)
